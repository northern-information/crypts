# new crypt discovered!

## my samples are:

- [ ] `.wav`
- [ ] 16 bit
- [ ] mono
- [ ] normalized, more or less
- [ ] 44.1 kHz
- [ ] less than 60 seconds each
- [ ] stored in a directory in the root of this repository
- [ ] the directory has a unique name and is around 10 characters so the norns parameters menu looks nice
- [ ] exactly six in number
- [ ] named `1.wav`, `2.wav`, `3.wav`, `4.wav`, `5.wav`, & `6.wav`
- [ ] my attestation the samples can be shared under the [CC0 1.0 Universal Public Domain Dedication](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) license. (hint: this means you made them from scratch or processed existing samples beyond recognition.)
